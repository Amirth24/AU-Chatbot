OUTLINE OF THESIS
The word CHAPTER without punctuation should be centered 50
mm down from the top of the page Two spaces below the title of
the chapter should be typed centrally in capital letters The text
should commence 4 spaces below this title the first letter of the
text starting 20 mm inside from the left hand margin
The division and subdivision captions along with their numbering
should be left justified The typed material directly below division or
subdivision heading should commence 2 spaces below it and
should start typing 20 mm from the left hand margin Within
division or subdivision paragraphs are permitted and they should
also commence 3 spaces below the last line of the preceding
paragraph with offset from the left hand margin by 20 mm
7
NUMBERING INSTRUCTIONS
71
Page numbering
All page numbers whether it be in Roman or Arabic numbers
should be typed without punctuation on the upper right hand
corner 20 mm from the top with the last digit in line with the right
hand margin The preliminary pages such as title page
acknowledgement table of contentsetc should be numbered in
lower case Roman numerals Pages of the main text starting with
Chapter 1 should be consecutively numbered using Arabic
numerals till the end of the thesis
72
Numbering of Chapters divisions and SubDivisions
The numbering of chapters divisions and subdivisions should be
done using Arabic numerals only and further decimal notation
should be used for numbering the divisions and subdivisions
within a chapter For example subdivision 2 under division 4
belonging to chapter 3 should be numbered as 324 The caption
for the subdivision should immediately follow the number assigned
to it Appendices if any should also be numbered in an identical
manner starting with appendix 1
90
73
Numbering of tables and figures
Tables and figures appearing anywhere in the thesis should have
appropriate numbers For example if a Figure in Chapter 4
happens to be fifth then assign 45 to that figure Similar rules
apply for tables For example if a table in chapter 3 happens to be
second then assign 32 to that table If Figures or Tables appear in
Appendices then Table 3 in Appendix 1 will be designated as Table
A13 Similarly for Figures
74
Numbering of Equations
Equations appearing in each chapter or appendix should be
numbered serially the numbering should commence afresh for
each chapter or appendix Thus for example an equation appearing
in chapter 3 if it happens to be the fourth equation in that chapter
should be numbered as 34 thus
y  at y  bt
34
While referring to this equation in the body of the thesis it should
be referred to as equation 34

BINDING SPECIFICATIONS
Thesis side pinningstitching covered with wrapper printed on
300 gsm white art card and outer side gloss laminated adhesive
binding The cover should be printed in black letters and the text
for printing should be identical to what has been prescribed for the
