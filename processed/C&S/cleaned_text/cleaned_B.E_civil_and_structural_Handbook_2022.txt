UNITI
Course Introduction  Need Basic Guidelines Content and Process for
Value Education
Purpose and motivation for the course recapitulation from Universal Human ValuesI SelfExplorationwhat is
it
Its
content and process Natural Acceptance and
Experiential Validation as the process for selfexploration Continuous Happiness and Prosperity A
look at basic Human Aspirations Right understanding Relationship and Physical Facility the basic
requirements for fulfillment of aspirations of every human being with their correct priority
Understanding Happiness and Prosperity correctly A critical appraisal of the current scenario
Method to fulfill the above human aspirations understanding and living in harmony at various
levels Include practice sessions to discuss natural acceptance in human being as the innate
acceptance for living with responsibility living in relationship harmony and coexistence rather than
as arbitrariness in choice based on likingdisliking

Holistic perception of harmony at all levels of existence
Include practice sessions to discuss human being as cause of imbalance in nature film
Home can be used pollution depletion of resources and role of technology etc
UNITV Implications of the above Holistic Understanding of Harmony on Professional Ethics
Natural acceptance of human values
Definitiveness of Ethical Human Conduct
Basis for Humanistic Education Humanistic Constitution and Humanistic Universal Order
Competence in professional ethics
a Ability to utilize the professional competence for
augmenting universal human order
b Ability to identify the scope and characteristics of
people friendly and ecofriendly production systems
c Ability to identify and develop appropriate technologies and management patterns for above
production systems
Case studies of typical holistic technologies management models and production systems
Strategy for transition from the present state to Universal Human Order
a At the level of individual as socially and ecologically responsible engineers technologists and
managers

COURSE OUTCOMES
By the end of the course
CO1 students are expected to become more aware of themselves and their surroundings
family society nature
CO2 students would become more responsible in life and in handling problems with sustainable
solutions while keeping human relationships and human nature in mind
CO3 students would have better critical ability
CO4 students would also become sensitive to their commitment towards what they have understood
human values human relationship and human society
CO5 students would be able to apply what they have learnt to their own self in different dayto day
settings in real life at least a beginning would be made in this direction
This is only an introductory foundational input It would be desirable to follow it up by
afacultystudent or mentormentee programs throughout their time with the institution Higher
