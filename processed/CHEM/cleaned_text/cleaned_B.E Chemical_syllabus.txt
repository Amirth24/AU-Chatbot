After the results are declared mark sheets will be issued to the students The mark sheet will contain
the list of courses registered during the semester the grades scored and the grade point average for the
semester
GPA is the sum of the products of the number of credits of a course with the grade point scored in
that course taken over all the courses for the semester divided by the sum of the number of credits for all
courses taken in that semester
OGPACGPA is similarly calculated considering all the courses taken from the time of admission
20 Awarding Degree
After successful completion of the programme the degree will be awarded based on
OGPACGPA
The conversion of OGPACGPA from I semester to VIII Semester to the corresponding
Percentage of marks may be calculated as per the following formula
Percentage of marks  OGPACGPA  025 x 10
Where
 Credit hours of a course
 Grade Point of that course
201 Honours Degree

the Dean of the Faculty
However if the student either does not clear the extra courses relating to become eligible for the
Honours Degree or discontinues it in any of the semesters then the student may revert to the category of the
First Class with Distinction or First class provided the student is eligible for that respective category The
