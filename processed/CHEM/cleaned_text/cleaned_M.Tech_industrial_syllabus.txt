A student who obtains less than 30  24 marks out of 75  60 in the theory  practical examinations
respectively or is absent for the examination will be awarded grade RA
A student who earns a grade of S A B C D or E for a course is declared to have successfully
completed that course and earned the credits for that course Such a course cannot be repeated by
the student
A student who obtains letter grade RA  W in the mark sheet must reappear for the examination of

4
The following grade points are associated with each letter grade for calculating the grade point
average and cumulative grade point average
S  10 A  9 B  8 C  7 D  6 E  5 RA  0
Courses with grade RA  W are not considered for calculation of grade point average or cumulative
grade point average
A student can apply for retotaling of one or more of his examination answer papers within a
week from the date of issue of mark sheet to the student on payment of the prescribed fee per
paper The application must be made to the Controller of Examinations with the recommendation of
the Head of the Department
After the results are declared mark sheets will be issued to the students The mark sheet will contain
the list of courses registered during the semester the grades scored and the grade point average for
the semester
GPA is the sum of the products of the number of credits of a course with the grade point scored in
that course taken over all the courses for the semester divided by the sum of the number of credits
for all courses taken in that semester
CGPA is similarly calculated considering all the courses taken from the time of admission
17
Awarding Degree
After successful completion of the programme the degree will be awarded with the following
classifications based on CGPA
For First Class with Distinction the student must earn a minimum of 68 credits within four semesters
for fulltime  six semesters for Part time from the time of admission pass all the courses in the first
attempt and obtain a CGPA of 825 or above
For First Class the student must earn a minimum of 68 credits within two years and six months for
fulltime  three years and six months for Part time from the time of admission and obtain a CGPA of
675 or above
For Second class the student must earn a minimum of 68 credits within four years for fulltime  six
years for Part time from the time of admission
The conversion of OGPACGPA from I semester to IV Semester to the corresponding Percentage of
marks may be calculated as per the following formula
Percentage of marks  OGPACGPA  025 x 10
Where   
  Credit hours of a course
  Grade Point of that course
18
Ranking of Candidates
The candidates who are eligible to get the ME MTech degree in First Class with Distinction will be
ranked on the basis of CGPA for all the courses of study from I to IV semester for ME  MTech fulltime  I to VI semester for ME  MTech parttime
The candidates passing with First Class and without failing in any subject from the time of admission
5
will be ranked next to those with distinction on the basis of CGPA for all the courses of study from I to
IV semester for fulltime  I to VI semester for ME  MTech parttime
19
Transitory Regulations
If a candidate studying under the old regulations ME  MTech could not attend any of the
courses in hisher courses shall be permitted to attend equal number of courses under the new
regulation and will be examined on those subjects The choice of courses will be decided by the
concerned Head of the department However heshe will be permitted to submit the thesis as per
