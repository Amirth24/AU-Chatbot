10 Design of Editor
LIST OF EXERCISES COMPILER DESIGN
1 Design a lexical analyzer for given language and the lexical analyzer should ignore
redundant spaces tabs and new lines It should also ignore comments Although the
syntax specification states that identifiers can be arbitrarily long you may restrict the
length to some reasonable value Simulate the same in C language
2 Write a C program to identify whether a given line is a comment or not
3 Write a C program to recognize strings under a ab abb
4 Write a C program to test whether a given identifier is valid or not
5 Write a C program to simulate lexical analyzer for validating operators
6 Implement the lexical analyzer using JLex flex or other lexical analyzer generating
tools
7 Write a C program for implementing the functionalities of predictive parser for the
mini language specified in Note 1
8 Write a C program for constructing of LL 1 parsing
9 Write a C program for constructing recursive descent parsing
10 Write a C program to implement LALR parsing
COURSE OUTCOMES
At the end of this course students will able to
1 Understand and use of assembler and loader
2 Understand and define the role of lexical analyzer use of regular expression and transition
diagrams
3 Understand and use Context free grammar and parse tree construction
