7 ProgramCourse credit structure
As per the philosophy of Credit Based Semester System certain quantum of
academic work viz theory classes tutorial hours practical classes etc are measured in
terms of credits On satisfactory completion of the courses a candidate earns credits The
amount of credit associated with a course is dependent upon the number of hours of
instruction per week in that course Similarly the credit associated with any of the other
academic coextracurricular activities is dependent upon the quantum of work expected
to be put in for each of these activities per week
71 Credit assignment
711 Theory and Laboratory courses
Courses are broadly classified as Theory and Practical Theory courses consist of
lecture L and or tutorial T hours and Practical P courses consist of hours spent in
the laboratory Credits C for a course is dependent on the number of hours of instruction
per week in that course and is obtained by using a multiplier of one 1 for lecture and
tutorial hours and a multiplier of half 12 for practical laboratory hours Thus for
example a theory course having three lectures and one tutorial per week throughout the
semester carries a credit of 4 Similarly a practical having four laboratory hours per week
throughout semester carries a credit of 2

18 The Semester grade point average SGPA
The performance of a student in a semester is indicated by a number called
Semester Grade Point Average SGPA The SGPA is the weighted average of the grade
points obtainedin all the courses by the student during the semester For example if a
student
takes five coursesTheoryPractical in a semester with credits C1 C2 C3 C4 and C5 and
the students grade pointsin these courses are G1 G2 G3 G4 and G5 respectively and
then students SGPA is equal to
C1G1  C2G2  C3G3  C4G4 C5G5
SGPA  C1  C2  C3  C4 C5
The SGPA is calculated to two decimal pointsIt should be noted that the SGPA for
any semester shall take into consideration the F and ABSgrade awarded in that semester
For example if a learner has a F or ABS grade in course 4 theSGPA shall then be
computed as
C1G1  C2G2  C3G3  C4 ZERO  C5G5
SGPA  C1  C2  C3  C4 C5
19 Cumulative Grade Point Average CGPA
The CGPA is calculated with the SGPA of all the VIII semesters to two decimal points
and is indicated in final grade report cardfinal transcript showing the grades of all VIII
semesters and their courses The CGPA shall reflect the failed statusin case of F
gradestill the courses isare passed When the coursesisare passedby obtaining a
pass grade on subsequent examinations theCGPA shall only reflect the new grade and
not the fail grades earned earlier The CGPA is calculated as
C1S1  C2S2  C3S3  C4S4 C5S5 C6S6 C7S7 C8S8
CGPA 
C1  C2  C3  C4 C5 C6 C7 C8
where C1 C2 C3 is the total number of credits for semester IIIIII and S1S2 S3is
the SGPA of semester IIIIII 
20 Declaration of class
The class shall be awarded on the basis of CGPA as follows
First Class with Distinction
 CGPA of 750 and above
First Class
 CGPA of 600 to 749
Second Class
 CGPA of 500 to 599
21 Project work
