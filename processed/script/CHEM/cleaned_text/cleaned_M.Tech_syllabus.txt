A student who obtains less than 30  24 marks out of 75  60 in the theory  practical examinations
respectively or is absent for the examination will be awarded grade RA
A student who earns a grade of S A B C D or E for a course is declared to have successfully
completed that course and earned the credits for that course Such a course cannot be repeated by
the student
A student who obtains letter grade RA  W in the mark sheet must reappear for the examination of
the courses
The following grade points are associated with each letter grade for calculating the grade point
4
average and cumulative grade point average
S  10 A  9 B  8 C  7 D  6 E  5 RA  0
Courses with grade RA  W are not considered for calculation of grade point average or cumulative
grade point average
A student can apply for retotaling of one or more of his examination answer papers within a
week from the date of issue of mark sheet to the student on payment of the prescribed fee per
paper The application must be made to the Controller of Examinations with the recommendation of
the Head of the Department
After the results are declared mark sheets will be issued to the students The mark sheet will contain
the list of courses registered during the semester the grades scored and the grade point average for
the semester
GPA is the sum of the products of the number of credits of a course with the grade point scored in
that course taken over all the courses for the semester divided by the sum of the number of credits
for all courses taken in that semester
CGPA is similarly calculated considering all the courses taken from the time of admission
17
Awarding Degree
After successful completion of the programme the degree will be awarded with the following
classifications based on CGPA
For First Class with Distinction the student must earn a minimum of 68 credits within four semesters
for fulltime  six semesters for Part time from the time of admission pass all the courses in the first
attempt and obtain a CGPA of 825 or above
For First Class the student must earn a minimum of 68 credits within two years and six months for
fulltime  three years and six months for Part time from the time of admission and obtain a CGPA of
675 or above
For Second class the student must earn a minimum of 68 credits within four years for fulltime  six
years for Part time from the time of admission
The conversion of OGPACGPA from I semester to IV Semester to the corresponding Percentage of
marks may be calculated as per the following formula
Percentage of marks  OGPACGPA  025 x 10
Where 
  Credit hours of a course
  Grade Point of that course
18
Ranking of Candidates
The candidates who are eligible to get the ME MTech degree in First Class with Distinction will be
ranked on the basis of CGPA for all the courses of study from I to IV semester for ME  MTech fulltime  I to VI semester for ME  MTech parttime
The candidates passing with First Class and without failing in any subject from the time of admission
will be ranked next to those with distinction on the basis of CGPA for all the courses of study from I to
5
IV semester for fulltime  I to VI semester for ME  MTech parttime
19
Transitory Regulations
If a candidate studying under the old regulations ME  MTech could not attend any of the
courses in hisher courses shall be permitted to attend equal number of courses under the new
regulation and will be examined on those subjects The choice of courses will be decided by the
concerned Head of the department However heshe will be permitted to submit the thesis as per

COURSE OBJECTIVES
At the end of this course students will be able to
 Ability to synthesize knowledge and skills previously gained and applied to an indepth study and execution of new technical problem
 Capable to select from different methodologies methods and forms of analysis to
produce a suitable research design and justify their design
 Ability to present the findings of their technical solution in a written report
Presenting the work in International National conference or reputed journals
Syllabus Contents
The dissertation  project topic should be selected  chosen to ensure the satisfaction of the
urgent need to establish a direct link between education national development and
productivity and thus reduce the gap between the world of work and the world of study
The dissertation should have the following
 Relevance to social needs of society
 Relevance to value addition to existing facilities in the institute
 Relevance to industry need
 Problems of national importance
 Research and development in various domains The student should complete the following
 Literature survey
 Problem Definition
 Motivation for study and Objectives
 Preliminary design  feasibility  modular approaches
 Implementation and Verification
 Report and presentation
The dissertation stage II is based on a report prepared by the students on dissertation
allotted to themIt may be based on
 Experimental verification  Proof ofconcept
 Design fabrication testing of CommunicationSystem
 The vivavoce examination will be based on the above report and work
Guidelines for Dissertation Phase  I and II
 As per the AICTE directives the dissertation is a yearlong activity to be carried out and
evaluated in two phases ie Phase  I July to December and Phase  II January toJune
28
 The dissertation may be carried out preferably inhouse ie departments laboratories and
centers OR in industry allotted through departments T  Pcoordinator
 After multiple interactions with guide and based on comprehensive literature survey the
student shall identify the domain and define dissertation objectives The referred literature
should preferably include SpringerScience Direct In case of Industry sponsored projects
the relevant application notes while papers product catalogues should be referred
andreported
 Student is expected to detail out specifications methodology resources required critical
issues involved in design and implementation and phase wise work distribution and submit
the proposal within a month from the date ofregistration
 Phase  I deliverables A document report comprising of summary of literature survey
detailed objectives project specifications paper andor computer aided design proof of
conceptfunctionality part results A record of continuous progress
 Phase  I evaluation A committee comprising of guides of respective specialization shall
assess the progressperformance of the student based on report presentation and Q  A In
case of unsatisfactory performance committee may recommend repeating the phaseI
work
 During phase  II student is expected to exert on design development and testing of the
proposed work as per the schedule Accomplished resultscontributionsinnovations should
be published in terms of research papers in reputed journals and reviewed focused
conferences OR IPPatents
 Phase  II deliverables A dissertation report as per the specified format developed system
