counsellor. He/she will be asked to present a seminar of not less than fifteen
minutes and not more than thirty minutes on any technical topic of student’s choice
related to Information Technology and to engage in discussion with audience and
will defend the presentation. A brief copy of the presentation also should be
submitted. Evaluation will be done by the student counselor based on the technical
presentation and the report and also on the interaction shown during the seminar.
