6. Implement the lexical analyzer using JLex, flex or other lexical analyzer generating
tools.

7. Write a C program for implementing the functionalities of predictive parser for the
mini language specified in Note 1
8. Write a C program for constructing of LL (1) parsing.
9. Write a C program for constructing recursive descent parsing.
10. Write a C program to implement LALR parsing
COURSE OUTCOMES
