Annamalai University stands as one of the largest and oldest universities in South India, known for its disciplinary diversity and significant student enrollment. Established in 1929 by the visionary philanthropist Rajah Sir Annamalai Chettiar, the university has been instrumental in the social, cultural, and economic upliftment of society for nearly a century. 

Situated on a sprawling 1000-acre campus in Annamalainagar, adjacent to the spiritual town of Chidambaram, the university comprises 50 Departments of Study across Eight Faculties. It traces its origins back to the early 1920s when Rajah Sir S. RM. Annamalai Chettiar founded several educational institutions to serve the underprivileged and promote Tamil Language and Literature. These institutions eventually formed the foundation for the establishment of Annamalai University on January 1, 1929, making it the first-ever university founded by a private philanthropist.

Over the years, Annamalai University has expanded its reach and impact, transitioning from a "unitary" university to an "affiliating" one in 2021, with jurisdiction over Mayiladuthurai, Cuddalore, Villuppuram, and Kallakurichi districts. The university now affiliates with 81 colleges, furthering its commitment to providing diverse educational opportunities under one roof.

Annamalai University's commitment to education extends beyond traditional boundaries, as evidenced by its robust Directorate of Distance Education (DDE), which offers accredited programs approved by the Distance Education Board (DEB). Additionally, the on-campus programs hold accreditation from NAAC, NBA, AICTE, NCTE, ICAR, and other competent bodies, ensuring quality education and holistic development for students.

The university's achievements include receiving an 'A+' Grade accreditation from NAAC in its fourth cycle of accreditation in 2022. With a focus on continuous innovation, research, and service to society, Annamalai University remains a beacon of excellence in higher education, fostering competent and well-rounded individuals equipped to meet the challenges of the future.
