space.
4.4 Holistic perception of harmony at all levels of existence.

can be used), pollution, depletion of resources and role of technology etc.
UNIT-V Implications of the above Holistic Understanding of Harmony on Professional
Ethics
5.1 Natural acceptance of human values.
5.2 Definitiveness of Ethical Human Conduct.
