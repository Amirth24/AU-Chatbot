7. Program/Course credit structure

As per the philosophy of Credit Based Semester System, certain quantum of
academic work viz. theory classes, practical classes, seminars, assignments, etc.
are measured in terms of credits. On satisfactory completion of the courses, a
candidate earns credits. The amount of credit associated with a course is
dependent upon the number of hours of instruction per week in that course.
Similarly the credit associated with any of the other academic, co/extra-curricular
activities is dependent upon the quantum of work expected to be put in for each of
these activities per week/per activity.
7.1. Credit assignment
7.1.1. Theory and Laboratory courses

Courses are broadly classified as Theory and Practical. Theory courses consist
of lecture (L) and Practical (P) courses consist of hours spent in the laboratory.
Credits (C) for a course is dependent on the number of hours of instruction per
week in that course, and is obtained by using a multiplier of one (1) for lecture and
a multiplier of half (1/2) for practical (laboratory) hours. Thus, for example, a
theory course having four lectures per week throughout the semester carries a
credit of 4. Similarly, a practical having four laboratory hours per week throughout
semester carries a credit of 2.
The contact hours of seminars, assignments and research work shall be
treated as that of practical courses for the purpose of calculating credits. i.e., the
contact hours shall be multiplied by 1/2. Similarly, the contact hours of journal
club, research work presentations and discussions with the supervisor shall be
considered as theory course and multiplied by 1.
7.2. Minimum credit requirements

The minimum credit points required for the award of M. Pharm. degree is 95.
However based on the credit points earned by the students under the head of cocurricular activities, a student shall earn a maximum of 100 credit points. These
credits are divided into Theory courses, Practical, Seminars, Assignments, Research
work, Discussions with the supervisor, Journal club and Co-Curricular activities
over the duration of four semesters. The credits are distributed semester-wise as
shown in Table V. Courses generally progress in sequence, building competencies
and their positioning indicates certain academicmaturity on the part of the
learners. Learners are expected to follow the semester-wise schedule of courses
given in the syllabus.
7.3. Registration for courses

A newly admitted student will automatically be registered for all the courses
prescribed for first to fourth semester.
8. Academic work

A regular record of attendance both in Theory, Practical, Seminar, Assignment,
Journal club, Discussion with the supervisor, Research work presentation and
Dissertation shall be maintained by the department / teaching staff of respective
courses.

The performance of a student in a semester is indicated by a number called

grade points obtained in all the courses by the student during the semester. For
example, if a student takes five courses (Theory/Practical) in a semester with
credits C1, C2, C3 and C4 and the student’s grade points in these courses are G1,
G2, G3 and G4, respectively, and then students’ SGPA is equal to:

SGPA 

points and is indicated in final grade report card/final transcript showing the
grades of all IV semesters and their courses. The CGPA shall reflect the failed
status in case of F grade(s), till the course(s) is/are passed. When the course(s)
is/are passed by obtaining a pass gradeon subsequent examination(s) theCGPA
shall only reflect the new grade and not the fail grades earned earlier. The CGPA is
calculated as:

CGPA 

PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY & PHARMACOECONOMICS (MPP204T) SCOPE
Scope

This course enable students to understand various pharmacoepidemiological
methods and their clinical applications. Also, it aims to impart knowledge on basic
concepts,
assumptions,
terminology,
and
methods
associated
with
pharmacoeconomics and health related outcomes, and when should be appropriate
pharmacoeconomic model should be applied for a health care regimen.
Objectives

Upon completion of this course it is expected that students shall be able to:
 Understand the various epidemiological methosds and their applications
Understand the fundamental principles of pharmacoeconomics.
 Identify and determine relevant cost and consequences associated with
pharmacy products and services.
 Perform the key pharmacoeconomics analysis methods
 Understand the pharmacoeconomic decision analysis methods and its
applications. Describe current pharmacoeconomic methods and issues.
 Understand the applications of pharmacoeconomics to various pharmacy
settings.
