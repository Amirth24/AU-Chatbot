Interaction etc.
 Suggestive clinical pharmacist's intervention with references.
Examination Norms:
University Examination (70 marks)


The final practical examination shall be conducted after completion
of clerkship.



The student has to present the allotted case and would be followed
by discussion.



Assessment parameters:
 ability to deliver clinical pharmacy services.
 planning of pharmaceutical care, and
 knowledge of therapeutics.
Sessional Examination (30 marks)



There would be two periodic sessional examinations and the total
would be the basis of calculating sessional marks.


Awarding of marks :
o Actual performance in sessional examination:
o

Day to day assessment of clerkship:

2821



Examination pattern :
o The student has to present the allotted case and would be followed
by discussion.
o Assessment parameters :
 ability to deliver clinical pharmacy services,
 planning of pharmaceutical

care, and

 knowledge of therapeutics.
