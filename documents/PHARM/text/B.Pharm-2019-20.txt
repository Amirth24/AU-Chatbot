APPENDIX
DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY
B.PHARM. DEGREE PROGRAMME
(Choice Based Credit System)
ACADEMIC REGULATIONS - 2019 [B.PHARM-2019]

This document shall be called as B.Pharm. Academic Regulations - 2019 of
Annamalai University. These academic regulations shall come in to force from the
academic year 2019 - 2020.
1. Short Title and Commencement

These regulations shall be called as “The Revised Regulations for the B. Pharm.
Degree Program (CBCS) of the Annamalai University, Annamalai Nagar”. They shall come
into effect from the Academic Year 2019-20. The regulations framed are subject to
modifications from time to time by the authorities of the Annamalai University.
2. Minimum qualification for admission
2.1 First year B. Pharm.:

Candidate shall have passed 10+2 examination conducted by the respective
state/central government authorities recognized as equivalent to 10+2 examination by the
Association of Indian Universities (AIU) with English as one of the subjects and Physics,
Chemistry, Mathematics (P.C.M) and or Biology (P.C.B / P.C.M.B.) as optional subjects
individually. Any other qualification approved by the Pharmacy Council of India as
equivalent to any of the above examinations.
2.2. B. Pharm lateral entry (to third semester):

A pass in D. Pharm. course from an institution approved by the Pharmacy Council of
India under section 12 of the Pharmacy Act.
3. Duration of the program

The course of study for B.Pharm shall extend over a period of eight semesters (four
academic years) and six semesters (three academic years) for lateral entry students. The
curricula and syllabi for the program shall be prescribed from time to time by Pharmacy
Council of India, New Delhi.
4. Medium of instruction and examinations

Medium of instruction and examination shall be in English.
5. Working days in each semester
Each semestershall consist of not less than 100 working days. The odd semesters
shall be conducted from the month of June/July to November/December and the even
semesters shall be conducted from December/January to May/June in every calendar
year.
6. Attendance and progress

A candidate is required to put in at least 80% attendance in individual courses
considering theory and practical separately. The candidate shall complete the prescribed
course satisfactorily to be eligible to appear for the respective examinations.

7. Program/Course credit structure

As per the philosophy of Credit Based Semester System, certain quantum of
academic work viz. theory classes, tutorial hours, practical classes, etc. are measured in
terms of credits. On satisfactory completion of the courses, a candidate earns credits. The
amount of credit associated with a course is dependent upon the number of hours of
instruction per week in that course. Similarly, the credit associated with any of the other
academic, co/extra-curricular activities is dependent upon the quantum of work expected
to be put in for each of these activities per week.
7.1. Credit assignment
7.1.1. Theory and Laboratory courses

Courses are broadly classified as Theory and Practical. Theory courses consist of
lecture (L) and /or tutorial (T) hours, and Practical (P) courses consist of hours spent in
the laboratory. Credits (C) for a course is dependent on the number of hours of instruction
per week in that course, and is obtained by using a multiplier of one (1) for lecture and
tutorial hours, and a multiplier of half (1/2) for practical (laboratory) hours. Thus, for
example, a theory course having three lectures and one tutorial per week throughout the
semester carries a credit of 4. Similarly, a practical having four laboratory hours per week
throughout semester carries a credit of 2.
7.2. Minimum Credit Requirements

The minimum credit points required for award of a B. Pharm. degree is 208. These
credits are divided into Theory courses, Tutorials, Practical, Practice School and Project
over the duration of eight semesters. The credits are distributed semester-wise as shown
in Table IX. Courses generally progress in sequences, building competencies and their
positioning indicates certain academic maturity on the part of the learners. Learners are
expected to follow the semester-wise schedule of courses given in the syllabus. The lateral
entry students shall get 52 credit points transferred from their D. Pharm program.
Such students shall take up additional remedial courses of ‘Communication Skills’
(Theory and Practical) and ‘Computer Applications in Pharmacy’ (Theory and Practical)
equivalent to 3 and 4 credit points respectively, a total of 7 credit points to attain 59
credit points, the maximum of I and II semesters.
7.3. Registration for courses

A newly admitted student will automatically be registered for all the courses prescribed
for first to seventh semester. In eighth semester, courses other than the electives are
automatically registered. The student needs to register for elective courses based on
his/her choice. This registration needs to be done a week before the last working day of
the seventh semester.
8. Academic work

A regular record of attendance both in Theory and Practical shall be maintained by
the teaching staff of respective courses.

9. Course of study

The course of study for B. Pharm shall include Semester Wise Theory & Practical as
given in Table – I to VIII. The number of hours to be devoted to each theory, tutorial and
practical course in any semester shall not be less than that shown in Table – I to VIII.

A learner who remains absent for any end semester examination shall be assigned a
letter grade of ABand a corresponding grade point of zero. He/she should reappear for the
said evaluation/examination in due course.
18. The Semester grade point average (SGPA)

The performance of a student in a semester is indicated by a number called
‘Semester Grade Point Average’ (SGPA). The SGPA is the weighted average of the grade
points obtainedin all the courses by the student during the semester. For example, if a
student
takes five courses(Theory/Practical) in a semester with credits C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 and
the student’s grade pointsin these courses are G1, G2, G3, G4 and G5, respectively, and
then students’ SGPA is equal to:
C1G1 + C2G2 + C3G3 + C4G4+ C5G5
SGPA = -------------------------------------------------C1 + C2 + C3 + C4+ C5
The SGPA is calculated to two decimal points.It should be noted that, the SGPA for
any semester shall take into consideration the F and ABSgrade awarded in that semester.
For example if a learner has a F or ABS grade in course 4, theSGPA shall then be
computed as:
C1G1 + C2G2 + C3G3 + C4* ZERO + C5G5
SGPA = -----------------------------------------------------C1 + C2 + C3 + C4+ C5
19. Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)

The CGPA is calculated with the SGPA of all the VIII semesters to two decimal points
and is indicated in final grade report card/final transcript showing the grades of all VIII
semesters and their courses. The CGPA shall reflect the failed statusin case of F
grade(s),till the course(s) is/are passed. When the course(s)is/are passedby obtaining a
pass grade on subsequent examination(s) theCGPA shall only reflect the new grade and
not the fail grades earned earlier. The CGPA is calculated as:
C1S1 + C2S2 + C3S3 + C4S4+ C5S5+ C6S6+ C7S7+ C8S8
CGPA =
------------------------------------------------------------------------C1 + C2 + C3 + C4+ C5+ C6+ C7+ C8
where C1, C2, C3,…. is the total number of credits for semester I,II,III,…. and S1,S2, S3,….is
the SGPA of semester I,II,III,…. .
20. Declaration of class

The class shall be awarded on the basis of CGPA as follows:
First Class with Distinction
= CGPA of. 7.50 and above
First Class
= CGPA of 6.00 to 7.49
Second Class
= CGPA of 5.00 to 5.99
21. Project work

All the students shall undertake a projectunder the supervision of a teacher and
submit a report. The area of the project shall directly relate any one of the elective subject
opted by the student in semester VIII. The project shall be carried out in group not
