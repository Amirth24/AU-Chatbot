19. Passing and Declaration of Examination Results
All assessments of all the courses on an absolute marks basis will be considered and passed by
the respective results passing boards in accordance with the rules of the University. Thereafter, the
Controller of Examinations shall convert the marks for each course to the corresponding letter grade as
follows, compute the Grade Point Average (GPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), and
prepare the mark sheets.
90 to 100 marks
:
Grade 'S'
80 to 89 marks
:
Grade 'A'
70 to 79 marks
:
Grade 'B'
60 to 69 marks
:
Grade 'C'
55 to 59 marks
:
Grade 'D'
50 to 54 marks
:
Grade 'E'
Less than 50 marks
:
Grade 'RA'
Withdrawn from the examination :
Grade 'W'
A student who obtains less than 30 / 24 marks out of 75 / 60 in the theory / practical
examinations respectively or is absent for the examination will be awarded grade RA.
A student who earns a grade of S, A, B, C, D or E for a course, is declared to have successfully
completed that course. Such a course cannot be repeated by the student.
A student who is detained for lack of attendance must re-register for and repeat the courses in
the respective semester.
A student who obtains letter grade RA in the mark sheet must reappear for the examination of
the courses except for Honours courses.
A student who obtains letter grade W in the mark sheet must reappear for the examination of
the courses.
The following grade points are associated with each letter grade for calculating the grade point
average and cumulative grade point average.
S - 10; A - 9; B - 8; C - 7; D - 6; E - 5; RA - 0
Courses with grade RA / W are not considered for calculation of grade point average or
cumulative grade point average.
A student can apply for re-evaluation of one or more of his examination answer papers within
a week from the date of issue of mark sheet to the student on payment of the prescribed fee per paper.
The application must be made to the Controller of Examinations with the recommendation of the Head
of the Department.
After the results are declared, mark sheets will be issued to the students. The mark sheet will
contain the list of courses registered during the semester, the grades scored and the grade point average
for the semester.
GPA is the sum of the products of the number of credits of a course with the grade point scored
in that course, taken over all the courses for the semester, divided by the sum of the number of credits
for all courses taken in that semester.
OGPA/CGPA is similarly calculated considering all the courses taken from the time of
admission.
20. Awarding Degree
After successful completion of the programme, the degree will be awarded based on
OGPA/CGPA.

9

The conversion of OGPA/CGPA (from I semester to VIII Semester) to the corresponding
Percentage of marks may be calculated as per the following formula:
Percentage of marks = (OGPA/CGPA - 0.25) x 10
Where
- Credit hours of a course
- Grade Point of that course
20.1 Honours Degree
