The third meeting will be held after all the assessments but before the University semester
examinations are completed for all the courses, and at least one week before the commencement
of the examinations. During this meeting the assessment on a maximum of 25 marks for theory
courses / 40 marks for practical courses, for Industrial Training and for Thesis work (Phase-I
and Phase-II) will be finalized for every student and tabulated and submitted to the Head of the
Department for approval and transmission to the Controller of Examinations.
13. Temporary Break of Study
A student can take a one-time temporary break of study covering the current semester and / or the
next semester with the approval of the Dean on the recommendation of the Head of the
Department, not later than seven days after the completion of the mid- semester test. However, the

A student who withdraws from or does not meet the minimum attendance requirement in a semester
must re-register and repeat the same semester in the subsequent academic years.
16. Passing and Declaration of Examination Results
All assessments of all the courses on an absolute marks basis will be considered and passed by
the respective results passing boards in accordance with the rules of the University. Thereafter,
the controller of examinations shall convert the marks for each course to the corresponding letter
grade as follows, compute the grade point average (GPA) and cumulative grade point average
(CGPA) and prepare the mark sheets.
90 to 100 marks
80 to 89 marks
70 to 79 marks
60 to 69 marks
55 to 59 marks
50 to 54 marks
Less than 50 marks

Grade D‘
Grade E‘
Grade RA‘
Grade W‘

A student who obtains less than 30 / 24 marks out of 75 / 60 in the theory / practical examinations
respectively or is absent for the examination will be awarded grade RA.
A student who earns a grade of S, A, B, C, D or E for a course is declared to have successfully
completed that course and earned the credits for that course. Such a course cannot be repeated
by the student.
A student who obtains letter grade RA / W in the mark sheet must reappear for the examination
of the courses.

The following grade points are associated with each letter grade for calculating the grade point
average and cumulative grade point average.
S - 10; A - 9; B - 8; C - 7; D - 6; E - 5; RA – 0
Courses with grade RA / W are not considered for calculation of grade point average or cumulative
grade point average.
A student can apply for re-totaling of one or more of his examination answer papers within a
week from the date of issue of mark sheet to the student on payment of the prescribed fee per
paper. The application must be made to the Controller of Examinations with the recommendation
of the Head of the Department.
After the results are declared, mark sheets will be issued to the students. The mark sheet will
contain the list of courses registered during the semester, the grades scored and the grade point
average for the semester.
GPA is the sum of the products of the number of credits of a course with the grade point scored
in that course, taken over all the courses for the semester, divided by the sum of the number of
credits for all courses taken in that semester.
CGPA is similarly calculated considering all the courses taken from the time of admission.
17. Awarding Degree
After successful completion of the Programme, the degree will be awarded with the following
classifications based on CGPA.
For First Class with Distinction the student must earn a minimum of 68 credits within four
semesters from the time of admission, pass all the courses in the first attempt and obtain a CGPA
of 8.25 or above.
For First Class, the student must earn a minimum of 68 credits within two years and six months
from the time of admission and obtain a CGPA of 6.75 or above.
For Second class, the student must earn a minimum of 68 credits within four years from the time
of admission.
The conversion of OGPA/CGPA (from I semester to IV Semester) to the corresponding
Percentage of marks may be calculated as per the following formula:

Percentage of marks = (OGPA/CGPA - 0.25) x 10
Where
- Credit hours of a course
- Grade Point of that course
18. Ranking of Candidates
The candidates who are eligible to get the M.E degree in First Class with Distinction will be
ranked on the basis of CGPA for all the courses of study from I to IV semester.

The candidates passing with First Class and without failing in any subject from the time of
admission will be ranked next to those with distinction on the basis of CGPA for all the courses of
study from I to IV semester.
19. Transitory Regulations
If a candidate studying under the old regulations M.E could not attend any of the courses in
his/her courses, shall be permitted to attend equal number of courses, under the new regulation
and will be examined on those subjects. The choice of courses will be decided by the concerned
Head of the department. However he/she will be permitted to submit the thesis as per the old
regulations. The results of such candidates will be passed as per old regulations.
The University shall have powers to revise or change or amend the regulations, the scheme of
examinations, the courses of study and the syllabi from time to time.
