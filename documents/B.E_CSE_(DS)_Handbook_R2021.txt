LIST OF EXERCISES
Write a function that takes two matrices as arguments and returns a logical value
representing whether the matrices can be matrix multiplied.
Find a free dataset on the web, download it, and load it into R. Explore the structure of the
dataset.
Write an R function to compute the interquartile range.
For each species of iris, find the correlation coefficient between the sepal length and width.
Are there any differences? How did we just combine two different types of the broad
categories of bivariate analyses to perform a complex multivariate analysis?
Download a dataset from the web, or find another built-into-R dataset that suits your fancy
(using library (help = "datasets")). Explore relationships between the variables.
Write a function that takes a vector and returns the 95 percent confidence interval for that
vector. You can return the interval as a vector of length two: the lower bound and the upper

bound. Then, parameterize the confidence coefficient by letting the user of your function
choose their own confidence level, but keep 95 percent as the default. Hint:the first line
will look like this: conf.int <- function(data.vector, conf.coeff=.95) {.
7. Read about data-dredging and p-hacking and formulate a hypothesis, set an alpha level, and
set a sample size before collecting data and analyzing results?
8. Use the library(help="datasets") command to find a list of datasets that R has already
inbuilt. Pick a few interesting ones and form a hypothesis about each one. Rigorously
define your null and alternative hypotheses before you start. Test those hypotheses even if
it means learning about other statistical tests.
9. Write a function that will take a vector holding MCMC samples for a parameter and plot a
density curve depicting the posterior distribution and the 95% credible interval. Be careful
of different scales on the y-axis.
10. Examine the various distributions on chosen data sets.
11. Examine and plot the pressure dataset, which describes the relationship between the vapour
pressure of mercury and temperature. What assumption of linear regression does?
12. Write a function called dt_table similar to the table function in base R. The arguments will
be a data.table, and a string specifying a column name. Do the same thing for tibbles and
call it dp_table.
Course Outcomes :
At the end of this course the, students will be able to
1. The power and domain-specificity of R allows the user to express complex analytics easily,
quickly, and succinctly.
2. Solve the difficulties relating to performing data analysis in practice and find solutions to
working with messy data, large data, communicating results, and facilitating
reproducibility.
3. Starting with the basics of R and statistical reasoning, into an advanced predictive

 To make the students to get hands on working experience in reputed concerns.
The students will work for two periods per week guided by student counsellor. They will be
asked to present a seminar of not less than 15 minutes and not more than 30 minutes on any
technical topic of student’s choice related to Data Science and to engage in discussion with
audience. They will defend their presentation. A brief copy of their presentation also should be
submitted. Evaluation will be done by the student counsellor based on the technical
presentation, the report and also on the interaction shown during the seminar.
The students will individually undertake a training program in reputed concerns in the field of
Data Science during summer vacation (at the end of sixth semester) for a minimum stipulated
period of four weeks. At the end of training the student has to submit the detailed report on the
training undertaken within ten days from the commencement of the seventh semester. The
student will be evaluated by a team of staff members nominated by the Head of the Department
through a viva-voce examination.
