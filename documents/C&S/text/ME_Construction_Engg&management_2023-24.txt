component – consideration of soil bearing capacity under different combinations of
soil types.
Factors Relevant to Structural Design
Ultimate load theory – plastic analysis – consideration on impact due to live
and dead loads – considerations of corrosion effects on structural aspects –
structural designs – construction below ground level.
Design of Overhead Water Tanks
Functional design – structural design – architectural design – cost aspects.
Design of Ground Level Water Retaining Structures
Functional aspects – maintenance factors.
Miscellaneous Structural Works
Design of conduits and appurtenances – foundation and jointing works in
pipe lines – prestressed concrete tanks – elevated steel tanks – rectangular and
