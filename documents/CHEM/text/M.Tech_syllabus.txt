16.

Passing and declaration of Examination Results
All assessments of all the courses on an absolute marks basis will be considered and passed by the
respective results passing boards in accordance with the rules of the University. Thereafter, the
controller of examinations shall convert the marks for each course to the corresponding letter grade
as follows, compute the grade point average (GPA) and cumulative grade point average (CGPA) and
prepare the mark sheets.
90 to 100 marks
80 to 89 marks
70 to 79 marks
60 to 69 marks
55 to 59 marks
50 to 54 marks
Less than 50 marks
Withdrawn from the
Examination

Grade ‘S’
Grade ‘A’
Grade ‘B’
Grade ‘C’
Grade ‘D’
Grade ‘E’
Grade ‘RA’
Grade ‘W’

A student who obtains less than 30 / 24 marks out of 75 / 60 in the theory / practical examinations
respectively or is absent for the examination will be awarded grade RA.
A student who earns a grade of S, A, B, C, D or E for a course is declared to have successfully
completed that course and earned the credits for that course. Such a course cannot be repeated by
the student.
A student who obtains letter grade RA / W in the mark sheet must reappear for the examination of
the courses.
The following grade points are associated with each letter grade for calculating the grade point

4

average and cumulative grade point average.
S - 10; A - 9; B - 8; C - 7; D - 6; E - 5; RA - 0
Courses with grade RA / W are not considered for calculation of grade point average or cumulative
grade point average.
A student can apply for re-totaling of one or more of his examination answer papers within a
week from the date of issue of mark sheet to the student on payment of the prescribed fee per
paper. The application must be made to the Controller of Examinations with the recommendation of
the Head of the Department.
After the results are declared, mark sheets will be issued to the students. The mark sheet will contain
the list of courses registered during the semester, the grades scored and the grade point average for
the semester.
GPA is the sum of the products of the number of credits of a course with the grade point scored in
that course, taken over all the courses for the semester, divided by the sum of the number of credits
for all courses taken in that semester.
CGPA is similarly calculated considering all the courses taken from the time of admission.

17.

Awarding Degree
After successful completion of the programme, the degree will be awarded with the following
classifications based on CGPA.
For First Class with Distinction the student must earn a minimum of 68 credits within four semesters
for full-time / six semesters for Part time from the time of admission, pass all the courses in the first
attempt and obtain a CGPA of 8.25 or above.
For First Class, the student must earn a minimum of 68 credits within two years and six months for
full-time / three years and six months for Part time from the time of admission and obtain a CGPA of
6.75 or above.
For Second class, the student must earn a minimum of 68 credits within four years for full-time / six
years for Part time from the time of admission.
The conversion of OGPA/CGPA (from I semester to IV Semester) to the corresponding Percentage of
marks may be calculated as per the following formula:

Percentage of marks = (OGPA/CGPA - 0.25) x 10
Where𝑶𝑮𝑷𝑨/𝑪𝑮𝑷𝑨 =

∑ 𝑪𝒊 𝑮𝑷𝒊
∑ 𝑪𝒊

𝐶𝑖 - Credit hours of a course
𝐺𝑃𝑖 - Grade Point of that course

18.

Ranking of Candidates
The candidates who are eligible to get the M.E /M.Tech degree in First Class with Distinction will be
ranked on the basis of CGPA for all the courses of study from I to IV semester for M.E / M.Tech fulltime / I to VI semester for M.E / M.Tech part-time.
The candidates passing with First Class and without failing in any subject from the time of admission
will be ranked next to those with distinction on the basis of CGPA for all the courses of study from I to

5

IV semester for full-time / I to VI semester for M.E / M.Tech part-time.

19.

Transitory Regulations
If a candidate studying under the old regulations M.E. / M.Tech could not attend any of the
courses in his/her courses, shall be permitted to attend equal number of courses, under the new
regulation and will be examined on those subjects. The choice of courses will be decided by the
concerned Head of the department. However he/she will be permitted to submit the thesis as per
the old regulations. The results of such candidates will be passed as per old regulations.
